mURL is an exploration of the use of cURL to enable asynchronous downloads in server.R

requires extended httr:

```

RStudio's shiny can use used to build an interactive front-end to data which is fetched (by the server-side app) from other remote web-services.  Often this means the server has to download multiple documents from multiple remote web-servers for multiple users, perhaps in response to ongoing user choices.

The remote web services it depends upon may not always be able to complete the transaction immediately, this can be due to : overloaded resources on the remote server, available network bandwidth in between, deliberate throttling, file-size, overhead of authentication, or in a not infrequent case, simple failure.

A naive use of the varied HTTP download functionality in R would tend to result in synchronous downloads, which would cause the shiny application to block (stop working) for the current user (and possibly all users) until the content fetch completed (or failed).

---

Shiny's reactive model points at a solution to this problem - instead of performing a synchronous download, initiate the request (in response to user input) and hand control back to shiny server.  A background function (or other mechanism) can monitor the state of the download.  Once the download is complete, a 'result' resultValue can be invalidated to indicate that an output function can process the downloaded data.

Note that asynchrony in this sense is not multi-threading - control must be explicitly yielded to libcurl and it's R wrapper to enable the download to proceed.  The advantage of asynchrony here derives from the fact that an external process (the remove web service and network) and operating system buffers operate independently of the R process.

----

This example is a working example of asynchronous downloading.  It is not at all a clean design, since it serves simultaneously as an experiment, a demo, and a dream of more power to come.

The goal
========

The end goal (as yet unrealised) is a shiny extension which can deliver the asynchronous power that HTTP (and CURL) can offer.  

This would enable:
 * deferred downloads 
 * non-blocking downloads - shiny remains interactive during download
 * parallelised downloads - multiple connections download at same time 
 * progressive downloads - partially downloaded data may be useful (or pretty)
 * spidering or nested downloads - partial downloads may be mined on-the-fly for more links to download

These can help support a shiny application which itself communicates with web resources or 
web services which may have a need for multiple high latency low content requests.

Current state
=============

The current design is a result of a conflict between the (unsatisfied) needs of a final design and the simple test case of a single asynchronous download.  It's just a proof of concept.

It currently features:

 * multiple asynchronous download
 * Progress monitor
 * Output based upon download completion

The test case is a word-frequency analysis of "war and peace" downloaded from project gutenberg.  The analysis and plot is shown when the file is complete, and during the download a progress report is displayed.

Design
======

The following proposed design is pseudo code and leaves out error handling, de-bouncing etc.

````
urlContent <- reactive(myurl = NULL)
urlMonitor <- mURL::newMonitor()

# a single input is bound to a single request
myURLqueuer <- observe({
	queue(urlMonitor, "myurl", GET(input$myurl))
})

# ... other inputs

# all live inputs are updated
commonURLMonitor <- observe({
	completedRequests <- workAndReturnCompleteness(urlMonitor)
	lapply(names(completedKeys), function(x)urlContent[[x]] = content(completedRequests[x]))
	invalidateLater(10)
})

# a single url is bound to a single URL
output$myplot <- renderPlot() {
	if(!is.null(urlContent$myurl))
	plot(read.csv(urlContent$myurl))
}

# ... other outputs
````

commonURLMonitor may actually be an internal property of urlMonitor, rather than being exposed to the developer.

Design questions
================

libcurl has a number of options for asynchronous downloads.  This is further complicated by the needs of rCurl to manage object liveness.  In summary:

Easy
----
'easy' synchronous rCurl (as used by httr today) uses one easy_handle, possibly repeatedly.  

The handle's HTTP/1.1 connection *may* be re-used which can help performance. (1) (2)

handles may be duped to start new connections.

The elegant Httr uses the Easy interface, although could trivially modify it to support multi by splitting the make_request function into a front and back end, and when GET(...,async=TRUE), returning the handle and a continuation for the decoder logic.  The handle can then be passed into the multi-interface.

Multi
-----
'multi' uses multiple easy_handles, usually duped from a template handle.  These are queued onto one multi-handle.  Optionally the user supply the required easy handles (see httr comment above)

The advantage of multi is that the multi handle can be invoked once to 'perform' partial or complete downloads on all the easy handles.  This is likely to result in reduced complexity and runtime cost in R applications.

multi can be used to implement single asynchronous connections, or even single synchronous ones.

Since multiple handles are used, HTTP/1.1 connections are not re-used by default, although it would be possible to implement a pool.  In addition, in the current implementation cookies are inherited from the seed handle, but not shared after that.

It's perfectly possible to have multiple multi handles, so there is a design decision between using the multi property purely for single asynchrony, and using a global multi handle to queue all requests on.

getURLAsynchronous
------------------

getURLAsynchronous is RCurl's interface onto Curl's multi-mode.  It allows multiple urls to be dispatched in a single call. but is limited in that it can only apply the same curl options to all of them.  

to add more urls to a multi connection later on (in response to new user input, or data discovered on download), additional calls to getURLAsynchronous can be made on the same multi handle.  These additional calls can have different curl options.

RCurl's interface complicate understanding of the relationship between multis and handles because it also has a role in object liveness tracking.  On each call it returns the multi-handle, plus the list of the new easy handles it has created to handle the requests, but does not include easy handles that were already attached to the multi.  Use with caution.

This leads to an design decision between 

(1) This may be particularly important if the user and server must mutually authenticate for each connection, as happens in one web API that the author uses.
(2) It may be perfectly possible to enable deferred and asynchronous downloads using the easy interface.  The Multi interface has the advantage that it can update all managed handles (for that multi) in a single call to libcurl. 

libCurl
-------

Exposing more of libCurl via RCurl may improve performance - for instance by exposing `curl_multi_info_read` completed connnections can be more easily detected.  Exposing curl_multi_fdset may allow the shiny runlook to attach selects to the fdset - allowing reactives to wake up only when there is real new work to be done (for the moment its done by polling).

Comments on speed
=================

Unexplored things: currently a single asynchronous download is about 50% slower than a single synchronous one.  This may be improved by better choice of buffer size, use of selects etc in the future.  This slow performance may not be a problem if it allows better parallelisation and responsiveness in the shiny application.
